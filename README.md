The user can request weather information from a specific city.

Each request will show the temperature and its variants.  The data also includes the description and icon for the weather and the name of the requested city.

It is possible to change the units of the temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

If the user tries to search for the empty input or the wrong city, the body will display an error message.

The project was made with learning proposes. To practice asynchronous Javascript and work with APIs. There are multiple ways to achieve this. In this project, I used a combination of async/await with a try/catch block.
