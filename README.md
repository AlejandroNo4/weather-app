</p>

The user can request the weather information form a specific city.

Each request will show the min, max and actual temperature. Also the description and icon for the weather, and the name of the requested city.

It is possible to change the units of the temperatures from celcius to farenheight.

If the user try serch for the empty input or a wrong city, the body will display an error message.

The project was made with learning propusses, to practice asynchronous Javascript. There are multiple ways to achive this. In this project, I used a combination of async/await with a try/catch block.
